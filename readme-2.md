**Project: Dynamic Navigation Menu Color Change**

**Description:**
This JavaScript code adds a dynamic color-changing effect to a navigation menu when the user scrolls the webpage. The menu changes color from #333 (dark gray) to blue when the user scrolls down more than 70 pixels, and reverts back to #333 when the user scrolls back up.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Event Listener:**
   - The code starts by adding an event listener to the `window` object, specifically listening for the `scroll` event. This means that whenever the user scrolls the page, the code inside the event listener will be executed.

2. **Accessing the Navigation Menu:**
   - Inside the event listener, the code retrieves the navigation menu element by its ID, which is `#navMenu`. This assumes that there is an HTML element with the ID `navMenu` in the webpage.

3. **Calculating Scroll Position:**
   - The code then calculates the current scroll position of the webpage. It uses the `window.pageYOffset` property, which represents the number of pixels the user has scrolled vertically from the top of the page. If this property is not supported, it falls back to using `document.documentElement.scrollTop`.

4. **Conditional Color Change:**
   - The code checks if the current scroll position is greater than 70 pixels. If it is, it means the user has scrolled down enough to trigger the color change. In this case, the code sets the background color of the navigation menu to blue and the text color to white.

5. **Resetting Color on Scroll Up:**
   - If the current scroll position is less than or equal to 70 pixels, it means the user has scrolled back up to the top of the page. In this case, the code resets the background color of the navigation menu to #333 and the text color to red.

**Code Snippets:**

```javascript
// Add event listener for scroll event
window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {

    // Get the navigation menu element
    let navMenu = document.getElementById('#navMenu');

    // Calculate scroll position
    let scrollTop = window.pageYOffset || document.documentElement.scrollTop;

    // Conditional color change
    if (scrollTop > 70) {
        navMenu.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
        navMenu.
